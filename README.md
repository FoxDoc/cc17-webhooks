It took the Apollo moon lander crew 2 hours to reprogram the computer manually by hand between stages of the moon landing!
There were no storage media devices at the time and the system memory was only 2K.
Can you imagine what it was like verifying each line of code so that there was no error and the lander didn't crash.
